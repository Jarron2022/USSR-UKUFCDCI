    Hello my name Is Jarron Stephen Sanders Singer Bell, and today is July 12, 2020. It all started when I was 6-7 years young in 1991-1992. When I lost 45 pounds from giving blood for some thermometer's, and a Sega Genesis Gaming cartridges. After my grandfather paid $7145 LIFE in Calculus to the Pottawatomie County Jail. Back then when I got lifted up on a horse Bar back while my RIP grandfather Cordell F. Sanders held the reigns. While I was up on the horse my grandfather yelled out "now there's your new eyes," So I didn't really think very much about that until me, and one of my grandfather's friends/helpers where in the bathroom talking and he said "are you sure you wanna do this," and then he went on to say " well if we don't do it now it will probably happen to you in College after you loose, and you'll probably Will never go on to win the World Series Unless we get it over with now," and then he said "are you sure you wanna do this," and me not knowing what he was talking about I said "yeah I wanna play for the dodgers," and then he knocked my eyes out of my head with one punch without blacking my eyes or anything I then started crying, and he said "Now go to the kitchen, and get your new eyes," so I blindly made my way to the kitchen, and when I finally got close boom my grandma popped some eyes in my head. And all of a sudden I could see again, and then she gave me a eagle feather, and said "now go into the closet, and get your new eye lashes." Those blue eyes that I lost on one of the eye's they cut off the eye cuticle, and placed that into a PlayStation Portable device that I drew at the bottom of a Royal Cup on one of those jail room desk tops at the Pottawatomie County Jail, but we was a my grandparents house at the time. The rest of that eye got plugged into a night light clip with Night light thermometers with my blood inside of them got plugged into the lightning system of micro chip shaped jail room number Q4 on January 6, 1992. Then shortly after that was my 7th birthday on February 19th, of 1992. When all the Micro chip missions that are underneath the paint around the window of jail door number Q4, Credit cards, Checks, and receipts from a 3rd party Got approved on my 7th birthday is what my grandfather said to me back then, and there is a larger sized jumbo chip of everything we Wrote underneath the garlic Union Paint Inside of my lost PSP With views of the colored paper cut outs, and the micro chips around the window are viewable from my Lost PSP on the jail door Q4, and there is proof that it says this is "Jarron Sanders Door" underneath the paint on the Q4 jail door if you know where my lost PSP is you can see what it says underneath the paint with that, or use some sort of Ex-ray vision lenses!!! . That's why we placed checks, credit cards, Receipts, and some other personal property internally inside of those jail door's in QPod! Not too Be messed with until January 6, 2022

I was  Lexington, Ok Bulldogs homecoming King using my secret service Name #10 Singer Bell. Where I was commissioned to play in that Game at the age of 7yrs young! This is how it all happened I was walking With my #1 Sanders jersey on, and this guy came up to me, and said here put this #10 Bell jersey on, so I did. Then the game was about to start so I walked over to the bench on the side lines, and set down. Soon as I set down some O lady started pulling down my football pants, and then she stuck a Thermometer connected to a LG Global Smart phone in my butt hole. Then I blacked out, and all I remember after that was her pulling the thermometer out after the small  medium league’s game was over that I played in, and her saying now here is your Queen, so what do you have to say to the audience about that? I kinda paused, and then in 1992 a 2009+ Orange Convertible Camaro from the future came driving across the field, and it was another man that I’m repeating his history Wearing #10 Bell, and he had a different Queen than me his Queen was Tiffany, and behind him was a Blue Challenger Convertible with another guy that I’m repeating his history also I think, but he didn’t have a Queen, so my Queen ran over there to the middle of the field where they then parked the blue challenger convertible, and then I said “fine if your just going to run off I’ll just find a new Queen then.” Then 3 girls came walking up Michael, Tiffany, and the Spartan 300 Queen is who she looked like. While still standing in the middle of the football field closest to the bleachers with the audience still watching! I said “since she ran off what one of you girls is going to be my new Queen,” and a much younger Tiffany said “I all ready have a homecoming King that I’m supposed to be with in the future,” and then the other girls said something, and then they walked off! That game I had played in as a quarterback but had no memory off playing in that game whatsoever, it’s because they memory of the game stays on the Memory card micro chip that must have been inside my lost P.S.P controller pad, and LG Global player packet kit, or smart phone, and a Sega Genesis, and Star Stand!! Then a few days Earlier, or later there was a talent show, and once again that same lady swooped me up, and put me in a daycare van, and put the thermometer back into my butt. Once again all I remember after that was her pulling it out, and then some guy on stage announced the winner, and it was me. He announced some of the names I was going to be using on commissions that’s are on my Guinness World Records USSR-UKUFCDCI ID I’m supposed to get in 2022. Hello my name Is Jarron Stephen Sanders Singer Bell, and today is July 12, 2020. It all started when I was 6-7 years young in 1991-1992.

That's why we placed checks, credit cards, Receipts, and some other personal property internally inside of those jail door's in QPod! Not too Be messed with until January 6, 2022, because hopefully there is another 5 year old right now that is going to repeat my history on those same micro chip memory cards around the window underneath the paint of jail door Q4, so I can have a 30th anniversary Homecoming King Football Game for the Lexington Bulldogs #10 Singer Bell For the medium, small league that I was on last time to the large XL league to the XXXL league. And of course I wanna get all my Q4 jail door and all other metals, and windows Up, and move it over to the star station side of the jail building because I was told when I was 6-7 years old when i get that jail door that I can draw art on it's window, and then photo copy that art and copy it  down on the backside of my credit cards On the black strip, and use the window as a magnifying glass To aim a satellite at the bank, and the doors window, With the art on the window that's on all The black strips on my credit cards, and I'm supposed to get to use the jail door handle, is supposed to be my credit card reloader packet kit! For my 17 credit cards Im supposed to be getting that's inside of a envelope up internally inside jail door Q1. You see my grandfather Cordell F. Sanders owner of Sanders Construction had a contract with the jail for about 90k to produce, and fabricate all the jail doors, bed racks, toilets, door handles, jail room desk tops, windows, and jail mirrors!! We had a heard of 180 head of cattle that we had to shot 5 shot 5 shooter black magic teredactor raptors Out on them, and it laid everyone of them down. We then just took Our big blades, and went out there diced there heads off for the cattle bone, concrete, and aluminum stainless steel For the door handles, and jail toilets, and mirrors! We also used phone!!! Well on the way home my grandma Cormae Walker/Sanders/Dobbs took that cell phone away from me, and said “Your not getting this, because you haven’t earned it yet, and  you got the LIFE in Calculus $7145 investment worth about a billion dollars in 2022 that I have to kindly share with the ones I’ve gone to war with, is what it says on Sparta Check memo the payout is  979,707,300 from  21st century Bank, and then to pay for the diesel we made while commissioned as Sparta with the Sparta Stars flying high above our heads. They then showed me a Carmel Corn Cracker Jacks Check for $71,450,000.00 that on the checks memo it says “ Jarron Sanders is the Treasurer of this Check with 71 recipients 401K+” My grandma when she took the 5,000 a month cell phone away from me she said there not buying a billion dollars for 5,000 a month for LIFE, so I agreed, but I still want that phone I said, and she said “to bad it’s mine now, and I will accept the 5,000 a month for LIFE,” so recently I did a search on her name, and it says that she makes about $59,000 a year, and had about 450k in Capital, but she is now in a Elderly home in Norman, Oklahoma so my cousin Theresa Lovings has that now I guess, because she is a probation officer in Cleveland County, OK, and she typed up the paper work to be her heir, but it’s kinda messed up when she only had that, because she took that 5k a month for LIFE away from me that I won at the talent show on stage at the Lexington, Ok Bulldogs in 1992 me Jarron Sanders. While I was going by the CMT name of  Christopher Young, because I was commissioned to sing one of his songs in the talent show, and I won! An right now I don’t have much because for 28yrs I’ve been negative on LIFE set on CRIM, and SHIT in calculus, so please help me raise this $7145, so that I can maybe get off of the negative side of LIFE! As of the moment I’m trying to survive off of SSI beneficiary sample recipient of only $783 a month! Very low income, but in 2022 it should get better! The only problem is  I don’t know the issuer of my 1992 muni bond. Other than Pottawatomie County Jail in Oklahoma, but in 2002 they changed the name to the Pottawatomie County Public Safety Center Trust, and they said the jail wasn’t built in 1993, but my grandfather Cordell F. Sanders with Sanders Construction had a contract with them for 90k+ in 1991 to build the Jail doors, bed racks, desk tops, toilets, windows, and mirrors!  I know this, because I helped him build most of this stuff when I was 6-7 yrs young! Back then the creator sent his assistant out to my grandparents house where I lived at the time to fabricate the Jail Doors. He gave us a photo copy’s of exactly how he wanted the doors designed with colored paper cut outs, Of cymbals, alphabetic words, numbers, and micro chips. That we eventually placed a layer of toilet paper over that, and painted it with Garlic union paint. Therefore you can’t see the colored paper cut outs that are glued to the jail door underneath the layer of toilet paper, and Garlic union paint without colored ex-ray lenses. I remember the door I wanted had all Gold Cymbals, alphabetic words, and numbers on it, but I didn’t get that one I got the all different kinds of colored paper cut outs Door Q4. I remember the Creators assistant going through a big book of micro chips, and every time he Pulled out another micro chip to glue around the window of my jail door Q4 he said now your going to have to do this one someday! Now what he didn’t say was I wasn’t going to have any memory of doing that, because all the memory is stored on the memory card micro chip of the game, or on the jail mirror in the micro chip shaped jail room, but I do have visions sometimes right after I wake up I’ve  seen myself do things on commissions that in reality seem impossible. I’ve also seen through other characters eyes! Like when I was doing time in Oklahoma County Jail in the a micro chip shaped jail room. I was in a really lucid dream where I could see through a highway patrol’s eyes, and it was like ex-ray vision, but everything was green, and I could see through a semi truck to the cars on the other side of the semi truck as they drove down the highway, and then I woke up! Well as fare as doing time, and getting arrested I guess that’s what happens when you play Police video game in Jr high school when after I arrested, and sentence someone else it says “ You could be subject to serve the same amount of time as the characters you convict on this game, after serving your time you could be eligible to convict for the same amount of time you served,” and I know I’m eligible in 2022, or 2023, because my grandma printed a $199,000. check for a Highway patrol package for me in 1991 inside of a Catalog. I guess that why there is a paper pattern of a highway patrol uniform internally inside of my jail door Q4, and the check is probably inside of Q1 Jeremiahs Door. She also printed a Law Abiding Citizen Check to law, and order for $100,000 that says on the check memo This is to pay for the expungement of Jarron Sanders Criminal Record, because they knew told me when I was 6-7 yrs old that I was going to get arrested 30 times on a 30 year Variable rate Muni bond bond to get all my Commissioned micro chip memory cards done That are underneath the paint around the window on jail door Q4 that the creators assistant said I had to get done back in 1991 when I was 6 yrs old!! I also remember playing monopoly with the monopoly man, and this monopoly wasn’t like your average monopoly board because it had 30 spots, or stamps on each side of the paper printed board game, so a total of 120 spots, or stamps total! I remember this because he showed me my Guinness World Records USSR-UKUFCDCI ID that’s a get out of jail free card that says on the back of the ID not to be held for longer than 24 hours only for Question, or Cummissions, and there was a picture of the characters tattoo that I’m repeating there history’s of a Holy crosses Crown with Weaponized Weeper Wings Coming out of both sides of the Holy Crosses Crown on my upper back, but I’m only repeating there history on memory card micro chips on the Q4 door, and a drawling of the Sample tattoo I had underneath it of a Heaven Cymbal with Titus Tribal off to both sides of the heaven cymbal in the center of my upper back! But back in 1991 I didn’t have that tattoo at 6 yrs old, so I have to be repeating someone else’s history on these memory card micro chip commissions! The monopoly man said with just one cymbal I can only give you one Sample, so since two, and three+ cymbals gets more samples than you during the first 30 yrs He said “I’m not going to pay them as much as much as I’m going to pay you once this investment matures,” because while I was over there getting arrested 30 times to finish up all my memory card micro chip commissions after my one sample for one heaven cymbal. That I got tattooed at 18 then covered up the sample heaven cymbal with the holy Crosses Crown on August 31, 2007 when I was 22 yrs old. My $71 sample was basically over. I’d say the sample lasted about 3 yrs after 23 yrs of age in 2008 in August when I got arrested to go to Red Rock behavior Center, and Griffin Memorial Hospital, and that’s right by the Oklahoma University stadium. Where Blake Bell was Playing, and Ive been plugged into IV league football at a Hospital when I was about 11 years old, and even though I’ve never attended the University of Oklahoma as a student I did trade a Guinness World Records & All sport check for $7,145,000.00, so I would only have to play 4 sports at the Oklahoma University for a $2,979,325.00 on the checks memo it says 60 stadium games as #10 Bell #23 Sanders, and #34 Wade that’s short for Wabnonene that means the Eastern skies in my tribes Language. That’s why two, and Three cymbals + On the back Wings  tattoo’s isn’t supposed to get paid as much as one cymbal tattoo, Because they got more monopoly samples, so they where more paid up than I was with one cymbal, but that’s why in 2022 After this 30 yr investment is matured  I’m supposed to get paid more than them! Anything over adding 3 digits to my original investment after 30 years I have to share it with a group of characters, because it’s hedged, , or below is all mines. Unless it’s below that because what they did was take a bunch of my 7,145,000 dollars, or pounds checks, and split it up between a group of us that on a commission we all used the same name! For example: my 2.9 million dollar Doctoral Credit card that I’m supposed to get in 2022. Well that’s, because there where 27 Dr. Stephen Schambach’s I’m the most highest paid one, because I spent the most time at the department during my 30 arrests, but I know that Brandon Gage may have Also earned 199,000.00 with me will doing some time after an arrest also commissioned as Dr. Stephen Schambach, and also my cousin Mark Sanders is supposed to be one of the ones who earns a doctoral credit card, but he forgot about it. My point is they have to spend the whole 7,145,000.00 on all 27 Commissioned doctors! Oh, and also I’m almost 94% sure that on the front side of my Guinness World Records USSR-UKUFCDCI ID it says at the top A.K.A Joseph Wabnonene then underneath that it says D.E.A. Stephen Schambach, and underneath that it says US1 Jarron Sanders then underneath that it says Singer Bell then Ronald Counge then it says Christopher Young, and there are more names on the backside of that Identification card plus get out of jail free card that the monopoly man showed me when I was 6yrs old before I got approved around about my 7th birthday in February of 1992 for all of this! I have a total of 12-17 credit Cards one of them is unlimited 3499 UKLA. I should have about 120 payouts for the 120 stamps on monopoly, but if I didn’t really earn it the least they can pay me is $7145 that is my original investment that my grandfather bought me in 1991-92 home. As of the moment I’m trying to survive off of SSI beneficiary sample recipient of only $783 a month! Very low income, but in 2022 it should get better! The only problem is  I don’t know the issuer of my 1992 variable rate 30 yr muni bond. Other than Pottawatomie County Jail in Oklahoma, but in 2002 they changed the name to the Pottawatomie County Public Safety Center Trust, and they said the jail wasn’t built in 1993, but my grandfather Cordell F. Sanders with Sanders Construction had a contract with them for 90k+ in 1991 to build the Jail doors, bed racks, desk tops, toilets, windows, and mirrors!  I know this, because I helped him build most of this stuff when I was 6-7 yrs young! Also, because the creator sent his assistant out to my grandparents house where I lived at the time to fabricate the Jail Doors. He gave us a photo copy’s of exactly how he wanted the doors designed with colored paper cut outs, Of cymbals, alphabetic words, and numbers,  and micro chips that we eventually placed a layer of toilet paper over then painted it with Garlic union paint on the jail doors, so you can’t see the colored paper cut outs that are glued to the jail door underneath the layer of toilet paper, and Garlic union paint unless you have ex-ray colored lenses. I remember the door I wanted had all Gold Cymbals, alphabetic words, and numbers on it, but I didn’t get that one I got the all different kinds of colored paper cut outs Door Q4. That says underneath the door handle’s welded cut out patch job “This is Jarron Sanders Door” remember the Creators assistant going through a big book of micro chips, and every time he Pulled out another micro chip to glue around the window of my jail door Q4 he said now your going to have to do this one someday! Now what he didn’t say was I wasn’t going to have any memory of doing that, because all the memory is stored on the memory card micro chips, or on the jail mirror of the micro chip shaped jail rooms, or in the Star, but the stars have shown me visions sometimes right after I wake up in a micro chip shaped jail, or Prison room. I’ve seen myself do some commissions that would almost seem impossible without the technology of my IS.6 and my lost P.S.P. Controller, and my lost LG Global Combat Pack, or Player packer kit, and star stand. I’ve also seen through other characters eyes! Like when I was doing time in Oklahoma County Jail in a micro chip shaped jail room. I was in a really lucid dream where I could see through a highway patrol’s eyes, and it was like ex-ray vision, but everything was green, and I could see through a semi truck to the cars on the other side of the semi truck as they drove down the highway! Well I guess that’s what happens when you play a Police video game in 
Jr High school, and at TRC call center that’s closed down now, but it’s in Norman, It was like after I arrested, and sentenced someone else on that real life video game at the end of the game it says “ You could be subject to serve the same amount of time as the characters you convict on this game, after serving your time you could be eligible to convict for the same amount of time you served,” and I know I’m eligible in 2022, or 2023 because my grandma printed a $199,000.00 check for me a Highway patrol in 1991 for a catalog Highway Patrol package. I guess that’s why there is supposed to be a paper pattern of a highway patrol uniform internally inside of my jail door Q4, and the check should be internally inside of Q1 Jeremiah’s door, and she also printed a Law Abiding Citizen Check to law, and order for $100,000 that says on the check memo This is to pay for the expungement of Jarron Sanders Criminal Record. They knew when I was 6-7 yrs old that I was going to get arrested 30 times on a 30 year bond with a variable rate to help pay for a county jail building to get built also to get all my Commissioned micro chip memory cards done That are underneath the paint around the window on jail door Q4 that u need ex-ray lenses to see! That the creators assistant said I would have to get done back in 1991 when I was 6 yrs old.
All the credit cards, checks, receipts are from a 3rd party not from the issuer that are internally inside of Jeremiahs Jail door Q1. Thats  why I don’ know who the issuer of my security is with until tell they post discloser articles on EMMA.MSRB.ORG, because they can wait up until 5-10 days before the bond is dew payments to post discloser articles, so I won’t know until January-September 2022.. I also remember playing monopoly with the monopoly man, and this monopoly wasn’t like your average monopoly board because it had 30 spots, or stamps on each side of the paper printed board game, so a total of 120 spots, or stamps! I remember this because he showed me my Guinness World Records USSR-UKUFCDCI ID that he said was my get out of jail free card after my 30 arrests, but it says on the back of the ID not to be held for longer than 24 hours for Questions, or Cummissions only!! That already had a picture on the back of a Holy crosses Crown tattoo with Weaponized Weeper Wings coming out of the sides of the holy crosses crown, and a drawling of the Sample tattoo I had underneath it of a Heaven Cymbal with Titus Tribal off to the sides of the heaven cymbal in the center of my upper back that I got back in 2003. The monopoly man said with just one cymbal I can only give you one Sample. So since two, and three+ cymbals gets more samples than you so after the first 30 yrs he said I’m not going to pay them as much as much as I’m going to pay you once this investment matures, because while I was over there getting arrested 30 times to finish up all my memory card micro chip commissions after my one sample for one heaven cymbal. That I got tattooed at 18 in 2003 then covered up the sample heaven cymbal with the holy Crosses Crown on August 31, 2007. My sample was basically over after 23 yrs of age in 2008 in August. I’d say the sample lasted about 3yrs. That’s why two, and Three cymbals + On the back Wings tattoo’s isn’t supposed to get paid as much as one cymbal tattoo, Because they got more monopoly samples, so they where more paid up than I was with one cymbal, but thats  why in 2022 After this 30 yr investment is matured  I’m supposed to get paid more than them! Anything over adding 3 digits to my original investment of $7,145 after 30 years I have to share it with a group of characters, because it’s hedged, and you know damn well it took more than one of us to get that large of an amount, or an account?! But anything that’s 7,145,999.00 , or below is all mines. Unless it’s below that because what they did was take a bunch of my 7,145,000 dollars, or pounds checks, and split it up between a group of us that on a commission we all used the same name! For example: my 2.9 million dollar Doctoral Credit card that I’m supposed to get in 2022. Well that’s, because there where 27 Dr. Stephen Schambach’s I’m the most highest paid one, because I spent the most time at the department during my 30 arrests, but I know that Brandon Gage may have Also earned 199,000.00 with me will doing some time after an arrest also commissioned as Dr. Stephen Schambach. My point is they have to spend the whole 7,145,000.00 on all 27 Commissioned doctors! Oh, and also I’m almost 94% sure that on the front side of my Guinness World Records USSR-UKUFCDCI ID it says at the top A.K.A Joseph Wabnonene then underneath that it says D.E.A. Stephen Schambach, and underneath that it says US1 Jarron Sanders then underneath that it says Singer Bell then Ronald Counge then it says Christopher Young, and there are more names on the backside of that Identification card plus get out of jail free card that the monopoly man showed me when I was 6yrs old before I got approved around about my 7th birthday in February of 1992 for all of this! I’m supposed to be getting a total of 12-17 credit Cards one of them is UKLA unlimited 3499. I should have about 120 payouts, but if I didn’t really earn it the least they can pay me is $7145 that is my original investment that my grandfather bought me in 1991-92, so with 120 stamps, Spots, Spaces, or structured payments all I ask is that they all give me a good account number in calculus, and with no curses in calculus on account numbers!?
